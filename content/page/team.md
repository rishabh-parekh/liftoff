Hugo is designed to work how you do.
Organize your content however you want with any URL structure.
Declare your own content types.
Define your own meta data in YAML, TOML or JSON.
Use indexes to group your content however you want.
Best of all this is all done with virtually no configuration, Hugo
just works.
